On the shoulder of gigants
==========================

Special mention to API requests handling. Behind the scenes, this package uses well-known `requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_ package to retrieve data from API. `Different errors <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/_modules/requests/exceptions/>`_ can happen and they are raised to be captured for the user.

It's important to say that these exceptions will include a custom field called ``requested_url`` that let's the user to handle the API url.
